## Description

ASF-FreeGames is a **[plugin](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Plugins)** for **[ArchiSteamFarm](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm)** allowing one to automatically **collect free steam games** üîë posted on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ASFinfo?sort=new).

---

## Requirements

- ‚úÖ a working [ArchiSteamFarm](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm) environment

## Installation

- üîΩ Download latest [Dll](https://github.com/maxisoft/ASFFreeGames/releases) from the release page
- ‚û°Ô∏è Move the **dll** into the `plugins` folder of your _ArchiSteamFarm_ installation
- üîÑ (re)start ArchiSteamFarm
- üéâ Have fun

## How does it work

Every ‚è∞`30 minutes` the plugin starts üî¨analyzing [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ASFinfo?sort=new) for new **free games**‚öæ.
Then every üîë`addlicense asf appid` command found is broadcasted to each currently **logged bot** üí™.

## Commands

- `freegames` to collect free games right now üöÄ
- `getip` to get the IP used by ASF üëÄ
- `set` to configure this plugin's options (see below) üõ†Ô∏è

For information about issuing üì¢commands see [ASF's wiki](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki)

### Advanced configuration

The plugin behavior is configurable via command

- `freegames set nof2p` to ‚õî**prevent** the plugin from collecting **free to play** games
- `freegames set f2p` to ‚òëÔ∏è**allow** the plugin to collect **f2p** (the default)
- `freegames set nodlc` to ‚õî**prevent** the plugin from collecting **dlc**
- `freegames set dlc` to ‚òëÔ∏è**allow** the plugin to collect **dlc** (the default)
- `freegames set clearblacklist` to üóëÔ∏è**clear** all entries from the **blacklist**
- `freegames set removeblacklist s/######` to üîÑ**remove** a specific package from the **blacklist**
- `freegames set showblacklist` to üìã**display** all entries in the current **blacklist**

In addition to the commands above, the configuration is stored in a üìñ`config/freegames.json.config` JSON file, which one may üñä edit using a text editor to suit their needs.

#### Additional Configuration Options

The following options can be set in the `freegames.json.config` file:

```json
{
	"autoBlacklistForbiddenPackages": true, // Automatically blacklist packages that return Forbidden errors
	"delayBetweenRequests": 500, // Delay in milliseconds between license requests (helps avoid rate limits)
	"maxRetryAttempts": 1, // Number of retry attempts for transient errors (like timeouts)
	"retryDelayMilliseconds": 2000 // Delay in milliseconds before retrying a failed request
}
```

**Option Descriptions:**

- `autoBlacklistForbiddenPackages`: When true, packages that return "Forbidden" errors are automatically added to the blacklist to prevent future attempts.
- `delayBetweenRequests`: Adds a delay between license requests to reduce the chance of hitting Steam's rate limits.
- `maxRetryAttempts`: Number of times to retry requests that fail due to transient errors (e.g., timeouts).
- `retryDelayMilliseconds`: How long to wait before retrying a failed request.

## Proxy Setup

The plugin can be configured to use a proxy (HTTP(S), SOCKS4, or SOCKS5) for its HTTP requests to Reddit. You can achieve this in two ways:

1. **Environment Variable:** Set the environment variable `FREEGAMES_RedditProxy` with your desired proxy URL (e.g., `http://yourproxy:port`).
2. **`freegames.json.config`:** Edit the `redditProxy` property within the JSON configuration file located at `<asf>/config/freegames.json.config`. Set the value to your proxy URL.

**Example `freegames.json.config` with Proxy:**

```json
{
...
  "redditProxy": "http://127.0.0.1:1080"
}
```

**Important Note:** If you pass a proxy **password**, it will be **stored in clear text** in the `freegames.json.config` file, even when passing it via the environment variable.

**Note:** Whichever method you choose (environment variable or config file), only one will be used at a time.
The environment variable takes precedence over the config file setting.

## FAQ

### Log is full of `Request failed after 5 attempts!` messages is there something wrong ?

- There's nothing wrong (most likely), those error messages are the result of the plugin trying to add a steam key which is unavailable. With time those errors should occurs less frequently (see [#3](https://github.com/maxisoft/ASFFreeGames/issues/3) for more details).

### How to configure automatic updates for the plugin?

The plugin supports checking for updates on GitHub. You can enable automatic updates by modifying the `PluginsUpdateList` property in your ArchiSteamFarm configuration (refer to the [ArchiSteamFarm wiki](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#pluginsupdatelist) for details).

**Important note:** Enabling automatic updates for plugins can have security implications. It's recommended to thoroughly test updates in a non-production environment before enabling them on your main system.
